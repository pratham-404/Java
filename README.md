This repository was created to provide a resource for learning and understanding Java programming language. The notes in this repository cover the basics of Java as well as more advanced topics, making it a useful resource for anyone interested in Java. It is intended for beginners who want to learn Java or for developers who want to refresh their knowledge of Java.

## How to Use

To use this repository, simply clone it using the `git clone` command and explore the folders to read the notes. The `notes.txt` files in each folder contain detailed explanations of the topics covered. 
Feel free to use these notes to learn or revise your knowledge of Java programming language.

The content is organized into three folders - `Java-Core`, `Collection-Frameworks`, and `JDBC`.

## Java-Core

The `Java-Core` folder contains notes on the fundamental concepts of Java programming language. It covers topics such as variables, data types, control structures, object-oriented programming concepts, exception handling, input/output streams, and threading. These notes can be helpful for beginners who are new to Java programming and want to understand the basics.
